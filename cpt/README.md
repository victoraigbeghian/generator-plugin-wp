yo plugin-wp:cpt <cpt-name>
```

Creates a skeleton custom post type using [CPT_Core](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CPT_Core) and [CMB2](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2) for custom fields.

You can optionally not include CMB2 by using the `--nocmb2` option when running the subgenerator.

Refer to [CPT_Core](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CPT_Core) for more details on extending the CPT_Core class.
