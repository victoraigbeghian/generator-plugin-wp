# generator-plugin-wp CSS Subgenerator

```bash
yo plugin-wp:css
```

Initializes styles for your plugin, including configuring the Gruntfile.js with the proper tasks.

The sub-generator prompts for type of style setup, either SASS with minification, or basic CSS with minification.

You will need to manually enqueue the styles.
