# generator-plugin-wp Options Page Sub-generator

```bash
yo plugin-wp options <options-name>
```

Creates a skeleton options page using [CMB2](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2) for custom fields.

You can optionally not include CMB2 by using the `--nocmb2` option when running the subgenerator, which gives you a basic empty options page for you to fill out however you'd like.

Refer to [CMB2](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CPT_Core) and the [CMB2 options page example](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/CMB2-Snippet-Library/tree/master/options-and-settings-pages) for more details on creating your options page.
